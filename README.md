# LoRa-SX1278

This repository contains streamlined sketches for the Arduino Nano to interface with the SX1278 (XL1278-SMT) LoRa transceiver. Both the transmitter and receiver examples leverage SPI communication with configurable settings for frequency, bandwidth, and spreading factor.

## Code Files

- **LoRa_SX1278_Transmitter.ino**: Configures and sends data using the SX1278 module.
- **LoRa_SX1278_Receiver.ino**: Receives data via the SX1278 module and outputs it to the Serial Monitor.
